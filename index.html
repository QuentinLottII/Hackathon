    <h1> About us </h1>

    <img id = "second" src = "picture/people.jpg">
<div class = "starter">
    <p> The site was founded last week in order to meet the growing need of jobs in the country.
        Everyday, teenagers sit idly without much to really do during their summer.
        Some kids in lower income families might need to help pitch in to support their families.
        We thought that it would be a good idea to create a website to fill both needs.
        This website will act as a portal to jobs, a door to new opportunities for both teenagers and young adults.
        This way, teens and young adults who don't have much to do at all can do something productive with their time and earn some money while doing so.
        Teens will be able to join the workforce, or a group of people are engaged or available for work, and gain valuable experiences and skills from their time.</p>

    <p> With this in mind, the amount of jobs that will be occupied in the city, temporarily or permanently, should increase signfigantly.
        This in term should help improve the job market in the city, as various demands for labor could be met.
        Hopefully this can get out to the rest of the country soon. </p>
